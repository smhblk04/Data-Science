About our Project
Problem selection is very significant since we are trying to select large data sets with many set points. Therefore, we choose a data set which is called UK Car Accidents between 2005 and 2015. Our data set consists of two different data sources which is called Accidents and Casualties. The casualties file presents a detailed information about the situations of an accident from 2005 to 2015 such as casualty type, sex, casualty severity, casualty age, casualty social class etc. and the accident file presents a detailed information about the situations of an accident from 2005 to 2015 such as location’s latitude and longitude, area type, road type, date, time, day of week etc. The motivation for selecting this data set is that the examination of road accidents is important to understand the factors involved and their impact. Accidents usually include multiple variables such as accidents severity, the gender of driver, the age of driver that’s why it is difficult to analyze the data. As we can see from the graph with variables of gender of driver and accident’s severity, it would come up with an interesting result because usually the expected result has a tendency of females cause more accidents than males, but the result is opposite. In the following visualizations, it is attempted to demonstrate how the variables interact with each other.
